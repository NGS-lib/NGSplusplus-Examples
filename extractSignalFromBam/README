This sample takes a bed file and indexed BAM file as input and will extract the density signal from the BAM file. It contains an example of a bamReader usage
As it only loads the data for one region at a time, the memory requirements are fairly low, unless the desired regions are very large.

The sample uses the TCLAP ( http://tclap.sourceforge.net/ ) library to manage the command line arguments and you will need to make the files available if you wish to build. 

The sample is not robust and may collapse for any number of reasons, including not providing the index file for the BAM file ( see samtools or bamtools to index your BAM file )
